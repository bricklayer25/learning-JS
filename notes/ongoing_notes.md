- Make sure to implement "use strict"; at top of code 

- note that JS supports many classes and modules that already enable script, but until I reach that point, including it is good practice

- semicolons can be ommitted but its not reccomended
    - i.e. alert(3 + 
                1
                + 2); can work but this is crap coding practice
