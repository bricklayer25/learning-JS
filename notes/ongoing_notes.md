- Make sure to implement "use strict"; at top of code 

- note that JS supports many classes and modules that already enable script, but until I reach that point, including it is good practice

- semicolons can be ommitted but its not reccomended
    - i.e. alert(3 + 
                1
                + 2); can work but this is crap coding practice

- variable definition:
     - var, let, const all viable but let and const are more commonly used, var is considered old school
     - let for defining any ordinary variable
     - const for defining variables that you would like to keep constant
